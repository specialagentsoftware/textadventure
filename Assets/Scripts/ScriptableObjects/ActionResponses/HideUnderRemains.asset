  requiredDescription: You do the disgusting work of lifting the remains just enough
    to slide under them. You then try your best to control your breathing and your
    heartbeat. Silently you wait, hoping that you were wrong and that the large mass
    rusting around the area will go away. A pair of large red eyes slowly slide into
    your view. The largest wolf you have ever seen is looking right down at you from
    above the remains. A drip of hot saliva runs down your forehead. You think that
    it is a shame that someone can die without even knowing who they are. You may
    restart the game by typing <color=yellow> reset </color> or you may quit by typing
    <color=red>quit</color>
