  requiredDescription: '"You decide to open and drink the water. The water feels
    cool and refreshing. You had no idea how thirsty you were. All is well until
    a few minutes later. Your throat begins to burn violently. You start having a
    hard time breathing. As you frantically search around for something that will
    help. You see some movement at the door of the kitchen. There is a dark figure
    watching you flail around. They appear to be holding a cell phone. As you slump
    to the floor you wonder if they are taking a video of your death and what they
    could possibly use that for. You may restart the game by typing <color=yellow>
    reset </color> or you may quit by typing <color=red>quit</color>'
