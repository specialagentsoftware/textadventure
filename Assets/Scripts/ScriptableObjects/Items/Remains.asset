  description: It is very dark, but after a long walk, you stumple upon what you
    think are possibly the remains of a large dog. It is cold to the touch and all
    of the blood has been licked up. You can see a gash along the neck that is wide
    open. You just now noticed that you are absolutely lost. You can't see much farther
    than a foot in front of you at the moment. No sooner had you thought about that,
    you hear the snapping of twigs and see a short flash of red, with what you think
    is movement.
