  exits:
  - keyString: cave
    exitDescription: Off to your left you see a dark void on a tall rock face. Probably
      a cave you think to yourself.

  - keyString: forest
    exitDescription: In front of you there is what appears to be a fairly thick forest.
      You can not tell how far it goes but it looks pretty dark from here. There
      is a path that looks as though it was made by animals.

  - keyString: road
    exitDescription: To the right is a small country road. It is paved but is badly
      cracked. There does not seem to be a lot of maintenance that is done. There
      are no street signs or traffic at the moment.

  - keyString: building
    exitDescription: 'Behind you at the moment there is off in the distance what
      appears to be a building of some sort. You can not see any markings or any
      other identification on or around the buidling. You can not tell if there is
      anyone there or not. You can not tell if it is a residence or a place of business. '

  firstVisitText: You awaken to find yourself laying on a rather uncomfortable rock.
    Your head is pounding. You are pretty cold and your mouth is very dry. You have
    no idea where you are, what time it is, how you got here or exactly who you are
    at the moment. As best you can tell it is either dusk or dawn. The light is dim.
